<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>The Mock Interview Initiative, which owns and operates the website www.mockinterviewinitiative.com (the "Site"), takes your privacy very seriously. This privacy policy is intended to inform you about the information that is collected from you when you visit the Site; how this information may be used and disclosed; how you can control the use and disclosure of your information; and how your information is protected. If you have any questions about this privacy policy, please contact our privacy team at privacy@mockinterview

1. Scope

This privacy policy applies only to the Site. This policy does not apply to information collected through any other website or to the practices of companies that the Mock Interview Initiative does not control.

2. What information the Site collects

We only collect information that you provided directly to us when signing up to the Site. We ask you to provide:
- Name
- School
- Degree
- Major
- Graduation Year
- Position type you are looking for
- Industry you are looking for

We do not collect information automatically neither do we access information about you from third-party sources and platforms (such as social networking sites, databases, online marketing firms, and ad targeting firms).

3. How we use the information that we collect

a. Search Engine

We use the information that we collect to run the database search: we match our users’ profile - interests and availabilities - to enable them to find peers to practice with. 

b. Email communication

We may use the information that we collect to send you e-mail communications, such as information about your account or changes to the Site.

c. Enforcement

We may use the information that we collect to prevent illegal activities, to enforce the Site's Terms and Conditions, and to otherwise protect our rights and the rights of our users. 

4. Information Sharing
The Mock Interview Initiative values your privacy, and shares information about our users only under certain circumstances. We only disclose your information to other users who match your profile. In that case, we will disclose your Columbia email address, interests and availabilities: that is how we make sure that users with similar profiles can find each other easily and practice job interviews, while keeping your information safe. 

5. Your choices

a. Update your profile

You can modify your personal information at any time by visiting the preferences for your profile. 

b. Deactivate your account

You can deactivate your account at any time by visiting the preferences page for your profile. When you deactivate your account, your user profile will be disabled, but your public comments will remain on the site. The Site has no responsibility to take down, remove, or edit any of your public activities or any submissions that are a result of your public activities. For more information, please review our Terms and Conditions. 

6. Confidentiality and Security

We limit access to contact information about you to employees or service providers who we believe reasonably need to come into contact with that information to provide products or services to you or in order to do their jobs. We also have adopted commercially reasonable technical, physical, and administrative procedures to help protect information about you from loss, misuse, and alteration. 
Please note that no data transmission or storage can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. We want you to feel confident using the Site, but we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us. 

7. Changes to the Privacy Policy 

We may update this privacy policy at any time to reflect changes in our practices and service offerings. We will notify you of any material changes in the way we treat your information by placing a prominent notice on our site or sending a notice to the primary email address specified in your account.
